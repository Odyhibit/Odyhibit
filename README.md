- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Josh Bloom

  Here, you will find my code solutions. Please note not all solutions provided have corresponding problems.

  For example, you will find my answers to questions like What if XOR was a mathematical operator? Can you use the Bacon cipher to hide messages the same length as the cover text? What would it look like to use Most Significant Bit steganography? How many bits of information can you hide in an image before it becomes noticeable? How few bits need to be changed to hide a message in an image? (turns out very few)

  There is a set of scripts that will continuously download new NPM packages and run YARA rules to try and find malicious packages.
