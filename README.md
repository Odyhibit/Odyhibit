- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Josh Bloom

  Here you will find my code solutions to problems. Please note not all solutions provided here, have coresponding prolems.

  For example you will find my answers to questions like what if XOR was a mathmatical operator? Can you use the Bacon cipher to hide messages the same length as the cover text? What would it look like to use Most Significant Bit steganography? How many bits of information can you hide in an image before it becomes noticable?

  There is a set of scripts that continuously download new NPM packages, and run YARA rules to try and find malicious packages. There is a script that performs a brute force decoding on rail fence ciphers, that uses a dictionary of common words.
